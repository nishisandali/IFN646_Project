To diagnose sleep-related health disorders as well as several other chronic health conditions, sleep tracking has proved essential. There aren't many wearable technologies that could be employed for this task. However, this study was performed by use of the Philips Actiwatch and the Apple Watch. 

The main objective of this study is to ascertain whether the Actiwatch categorization can serve as a foundation for the Apple Watch to classify sleep and wake periods with any degree of accuracy. 

The dataset that was given to us included data on 14 individuals' sleep patterns over the course of two days. The study employed the approach to predict actiwatch activity counts using the Apple watch ENMO data and use that in the actiwatch classification algorithm.
